# IF.js
IF.js is a JS library for making interactive fiction/CYOA books on the web.
You can see an example of it [here](https://averseabfun.github.io/IF.js), you can also see the code for that in the index.html file. The actual code for the library is in `if.js` and to import it you can do:
```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AverseABFun/IF.js/if.js"></script>
```
And you should be fine! Note that IF.js requires that the localstorage value `gameVars` be available and not used for anything else. Documentation is being worked on, but as of now I suggest looking at the example(and it's code) and at the library code itself, which is pretty basic.
